# GallopAI
GallopAI uses machine learning to predict horse race outcomes based on historical data. It's a valuable tool for enthusiasts and researchers interested in data analytics, machine learning, or sports predictions.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have installed:
- Python 3
- Tensorflow
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-Learn

## Dataset
The project uses two datasets which are CSV files:
1. `penraces2022.csv`: Contains historical horse race data.
2. `race1testdata.csv`: Contains data for the race we want to predict.

## Usage
To run the script, use the following command in the terminal:
```bash
python racepredictionswithactualresults.py
